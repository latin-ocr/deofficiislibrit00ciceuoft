6. Intelligendum est] “Although intelliyendum est often occurs in this
work in the sense of intelliqitur or facile potest intelam, still it implies, at
tho same time, that it is proper or becoming to see or understand.'’ Z. Gr.
ἓ 650. Honestas] differs from honestum of the preceding sentence as the
abstract differs from the concrete. Illaozaret] Z. Gr. ξ 514. Animo]
is not the ablative of the voluntary agent.

7. In promptu] at the tonyue's encl. Si quid tale clici potest] i. e. if the
case allows the use of any such quotation. Illa virago viri] sc. animum
yerit. Supposed to be a quotation from Ennius respecting· Cloelia. Et
si quid ejusmodi] sc. dici potest. Salmaoi . . . . sanyuine] Observe the
metaphorical use of the proper name—Da spolia, dxc„ surrender your
amor without a struyyle and without bloodshed. Bonneu, adopting the
explanation of Elvenich, (Progr. Breslau, 1834,) drops the comma after
spolia and makes sine wdore et sanquine attributive of spolia. Surrender
your εωεαιῖεεε, bloodless arms, i. e. the arms which you have refused to use
in battle.

8. Quae . . . fortiter yesta sunt, ea laudamus] According to Madvig,
(Latein. Sprachlehre fi Schulen, ἓ 324,) the antecedent is often placed after
the relative clause, when it is a demonstrative pronoun standing alone.

9. Hinc rhetorum campus] Comp. auct. dial. de Oratoribus: est aliquis
oratorum campus, per quem nisi liberi et soluti ferantur, debilitatur ac sran—
qitur eloquentia. Hinc, hence, i. e. because we love to praise such deeds.
Hi'nc noster Cocles, hinc Decii . . . . alii] The elder Heusinger supplies
excellunt, anticipating it from the next clause. To this construction the
nephew objects. He prefers to supply only the substantive verb, as in the
preceding sentence, hinc rhetorum, dcc. With this construction, the connec—
tion of thought would be: hence, (that is, because we bestow such praises
on brave exploits,) hence our Cocles, hence the Decii, dxc„ for without these
praises there would be no Cocles, his name would long since have passed
away. He might have been just as brave, to be sure, but without these
praises we should now have no such character in our history, for his name
would have been forgotten.

Such would be the connection of thought, unless Heusinger under-
stood that the general disposition to praise such conduct was the cause of
the bravery of Cocles and the rest. But this is improbable. Zumpt would
supply omnium commemoratione celebrantur, which falls -in with the spirit
of the context. Declaratur autem . . . . quod statuas quoque] statues also,
not merely living men. Steurenburg.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cn. XIX. See Conspectus—1. In vitio est] Comp. 7, 8.

2. Eam virtutem esse] eam is the subject, virtutem the predicate.

4. Audaciae nomen habeat] Cicero drops from the periphrastic form
appellandus est, which exact correspondence with the preceding sentence
would require, into the pres. subj. with the imperative signification.
