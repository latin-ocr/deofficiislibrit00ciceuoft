the occurrence of nostra and nostris in the same sentence. Exact consist-
ency would require either impedimus or mea and meis.

Leqendis nostris] A repetition of nostra leqens, occasioned by the intro-
duction of the intervening parenthetical clauses.

4. Scientiam] skill ; as scire, to know how.

5. Hos de philosophia libros] It is evident from the words: qui illis
se aequarunt, that Cicero has here in mind all his philosophical writings,
and not merely this work, de Officiis.

6. Ut idem elaboraret, sequereturque] Elaborare means to labor with suc-
cess. Laborare, when used alone, implies a want of success, which signifi-
cation it loses when it is, joined with a word of opposite meaning. Comp
de Orat. III. 33. Utroque in qenere et laboravit et proestitit. Sequi, to
endeavor to attain.

Phalereus] For the pronunciation of this and similar words, see Z. Gr
ἓ 52. 4. For Cicero’s opinion of the style of Phalereus and of Theophrastus,
the master of Phalereus, see Brutus, IX. and XXXI. The chief merit ol
Phalereus consisted in this, that he set forth the doctrines of the Peripatetics
in a popular and pleasing style. A. W. Z.

Disputator] For the meaning of this word observe its derivation.

8. Potuisse] Z. Gr. ἓ 593, ἓ 518. Alterum] sc. studium instead of stu>
dium alterius.

 

¹ Cn. II. 1. sed] This word serves to recall from the digression of the
preceding chapter to the proper introduction to his work. Z. Gr. ἓ 503.

2. Nam] The course of thought is as follows: Inasmuch as I had deter-
mined to write to you somewhat at the present time, and much hereafter, I
desired especially to begin with that which should be best suited both to
your time of life and to my character. Ι accordingly made ethice my sub-
ject. For, etc. The reason for the omission in the text of the clause to
which nam refers, is obvious without explanation. He proceeds to give
the first reason for the selection of his subject. The second reason is found
below, ἓ 4. Atque hcec‚ ac.

4. Hoec quidem quaestio] instead of quoestio de hac re.

Tradendis] Z. Gr. ξ 643. Respecting the present signification of this
participle, see Z. Gr. ἓ 652.

5. Disciplinae] Schools, sects ofphilosophers.

Bonorum et malorum finibus] Finis bonorum is the hiyhest qood; finis
malorum, the qreatest evil. Comp. Cic. de Fin. III. 7. Z. Gr. ἓ 563.

6. Hic si sibi ipse consentiat . . . . vincatur . . . . possit] This man, if heis
comistent with himself and is not sometimes overcome by the qoodness of
his natural character, can cultivate neither frimdship, nor justice, nor yen-
