on the instructions of Cratippus; and further, that Cicero does not intend
to speak with exactness in using the words annum jam audientem. Comp

Cratippum] Cicero’s opinion of this master of the Peripatetic school
may be leamed from ἓ 3 of this section, from 111, 2, 2. and de Fin. I, 3
5. B.

quue Athenis] Z. Gr. ἓ 699. The case of this pronoun may be learned
from the nature of the clause which it represents. An illustration of the
pn'nciple may be derived from the examples from Euripides, cited in
Crosby’s Gr. Gr. ξ 334. Ἑλένην κτάνωμεν, Μενέλεῳ λύπην πικράν. Here λύπην
is in the accusative case, because the clause to which it refers contains a
transitive verb and its object. The writer, having one and the same thing
in his mind all the time, gives the same form to his thoughts in both clauses.
Let us stay Helen, [let us cause] a bitter yrief to Menelaus. In the other
example the nominative case is used. Στίφη μιαίνεται, θεῶν ἀτιμία, our yar-
lande are prosaned, [which is] a dishonor to the yods.

Praeceptis institutisque] principles and practical rules. The former
word refers to theoretical philosophy—the latter, to the practical rules of
life.

In utriusque orationis facultate] that γοα may have equal facility in
both styles of discoursc, namely, the oratorical and the philosophical. That
such is the meaning of these words would appear from the next sentence,
which can scarcely be interpreted satisfactorily if the author be supposed
to refer to the Greek and Latin languages in the words utriusque orationis.
The meaning of the sentence seems to be substantially this: As 1 have
found it advantageous in philosophy and oratory, to give my attention to
Greek as well as Latin stuffles, I advise you to do the same, that you may
have equal readiness as an orator and a philosopher.

The proper correlative of ut would be ita. Instead os it we find idem,
which, according to Gemhard, refers not to ut but id. May not this be
considered a slight additional reason sor the interpretation of utriusque ora-
tionis which is given in this note}> G. B.

2. Ut videmur] Z. Gr. ξ 380.

Docti] Cicero called those indocti who were unacquainted with Greek
literature. See Acad. Quaest. I, 2.

Aliquantum] Z. Gr. 5488.

Et ad dicendum et adjudicandum] for their aid not only as orators, but
also as philosophers.

3. Disces tu quidem . . . . et disces] For similar repetition for the sake of
emphasis, see 25, 10„ 27, 7. Τ116 future is here a softened imperative.
Z. Gr. ἓ 586. Tu quidem. Z. Gr. ξ 278.

Utrique] that is, both the sects, (the N ew Academy and the Peripatetics)
‘o one of which Cicero, to the other Cratippus, belonged. Z. Gr. ἓ 141.

Impedio] Observe that the singular number is used, notwithstanding
