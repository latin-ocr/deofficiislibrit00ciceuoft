tional nature transferring the likeness of this from the eyes to the mind
i. e. transferring the idea of beauty, dxc„ from the objects of vision to the
attributes of the soul. Comp. B. and Garve.

Cmervandum] Z. Gr. ἓ 37 6.

9. Etiamsi nobilitatum mm sit] This is aimed at the opinion of Epicu-
rus: qui negat se intelliyere quid sit honestum, si id non est in voluptate,
nisisorte illud, quod multitudinis rumore laudatur. (Fin.
2, 15.)

Honestum est] est has been preferred to sit in this edition. Zumpt re-
tains the sit of Heusinger, the construction being similar to that of the suh·
junctive in the apodosis in chapter 2, 6. Beier and Orelli prefer est.

A nullo] used substantively instead of nemine. Z. Gr. ξ 676.

In this fourth chapter Cicero enters on the discussion of the honestum,
by making a cursory examination of the nature of man, designing thereby
to settle the basis of his subsequent subdivision of the honestum into the
four cardinal virtues, viz„ justitia, (see ἓ 4,) sapientia, (see ἓ 5,) ⁷71a9nitudo
animi, (ἓ 6,) temperantia, (ξ 7 and ξ 8.)

Cn. V. 1. Formam.. .sapientioe] somnam embodies ‚faciem personifies,
moral goodness. Doederlein, IV. 318. Cicero refers to this passage,
Phaedrus of Plato, (see 65 ,) in the second book de Finibus c. 16, where he
translates it as follows: oculorum est in nobis sensus acerrimus, quibus sa-
pientiam non cernimus ‚· quam illa ardentes amares excitaret sui, si vide-
retur J

2. Rerum contractarum] fidelity in τέρατά to contracts. Instead of rec
contractae, contractus was afterwards used.

3. Quae prima descripta est] which was-first set qff (from the rest.) Sapi-
entia and prudentia are the moral qualities which correspond to the per-
spicientia veri sollertiaque, while irzdayatio atque inventio veri are the cor·
responding moral duties. B.

Velut ex ea parte.. . . inest] By this anacoluthon Cicero avoids the repe·
tition of nascuntur, the last word of the preceding sentence.

Ejusque virtutis] scil. sapientioe et prudentioe‚ which are not distinguished
here as in Chap. 43.

4. Ut em'm quisque . . . . is] Another example of anacoluthon, occasioned
by the introduction of the relative clause: quique, etc. Otherwise sic or ita
would have followed to correspond with ut.

5. Huic] scil. virtuti.

Reliquis autem tribus virtutibus] sciL justitia, fortitudini, temperantioe.

Necessitates] the necessary external relations of life. B. Compare 44,
10. The field of the three remaining virtues is human needs, and laboring
here, it is their business to create and preserve those things in which prae-
tioel life (life’s action) is comprised. Thus justitia has to do with the ee·
tablishment and maintenanoe of society, dm.
