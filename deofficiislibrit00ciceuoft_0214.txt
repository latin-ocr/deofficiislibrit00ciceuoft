The publishers believe that in this edition of Livy a want is supplied which has
been universally fe1t; there being previous to this no American edition furnished
with the requisito, aids for the successful study of this Latin author. The text is
chiefly that of Alschefski, which is now generally received by the best critics. The
notes have been prepared with special reference to the grammatical study os the
1anguage, and the illustration of its forms, constructione, and idioms‚ as used by
Livy. They will not be round to foster habits of dependence in the student, by
supplying indiscriminate translation or unnecessary assistance3 but come to his help
only in such parts as it is fair to suppose he cannot master by his own exertions.
They also embrace all necessary information relating to history, geography, and an-
tiqujties.

Lincolu·s Livy has been highly commended by critics, and is used in nearly all
the colleges in the country.

From Pnor. mnaso& os Waterville Colleqe.

“A careful examination of several portions of your work has convinced me that,
sor the use of students, it is altogether superior to any edition of Livy with which 1
am acquainted. Among its excellencies you will permit me to name the close atten-
tion given to particles, to the subjunctive mood, the constant reference to the am-
mars, the discrimination ol words nearly synonymous, and the care in giving t e lo
calities mentioned in the text. The book will be hereaster used in our college.”

The now acknowledged propriety os giving students of languages familiar works
for translation—thus adopting in the schools the mode by which the child first learns
to talk—has induced the publication os this new American edition of Beza's Latin
Ver-sion of the N ew Testaenent. Ever since its first appearance, this work has kept
{ts place in the general esteem; while more recent versions have been so strongly
tinged with the peculiar views of the translators as to make them acceptable to par-
ticular classes only. The editor has exerted himself to render the present edition
vorthy of patronage by its superior accuracy and neatness; and the publishers flatter
themselves that the paine bestowed will insui-e {or it apreference over other editions.
