5. E quo . . . . appetet] e quo is the logical object of the verb, but gram—
matica-Hy aliquid must be supplied.

A Platone] See ninth letter ad Archytam.

onusque] After a negative clause que, as well as et, has often an ad-
versative signification. Ortus cannot be construed strictly, yet it follows
nati sunt naturally, and we may use a similar expression in English: we
have not been born for ourselves alone3 but our country claims an interest,
our friends an interest in (lit. a share of) our birth.

Quoniam . . . nati sumus . . . atque, ut placet Stoicis . . . creari] Observe
the anacoluthon. Instead of creantur we have creari, which depends on placet.

Oommwnes . . . . afferre] Compare 16, 8. The duties which Cicero finds
enjoined by nature are twofold: (1.) to labor to render those things acces-
sible to all which are useful to the public generally3 (2.) to aid in strength-
em'ng the bonds of human society by the interchange of kind offices—muta-
tione effic-iorum is the general term which includes the particulare next
mentioned. Comp. B.

Tum . . . . tum . . . . tum] Compare 44, 11, where it is used four times.

Artes] Compare chapter 42. Β.

6. Fundamentum justitiae] In ἓ 2 he states the two munera justitiae..
He now establishes it on the basis of good saith.

Quia fiat . . . . fidem] In another place Cicero says: Fides enim nomen
ipsum mihi videtur habere, quum fit, quod dicitur. De Rep. IV, ’1, 21.
Orelli’s edition. Fiat] Z. Gr. ἓ 546.

’1. See Conspectus.

8. Aliqua perturbatione] animi commonly follows perturbatio. Comp.
8, 9. 20, l—aliqua for alia qua, for ira is a perturbatio animi. Zumpt (ad
Verr. V. 28, ’72) sayS, Nam aliquis saepissime est pro alius quis. Compare
objections to this explanation in Neue J ahrb.‚ vol. 55, p. 171.

Ie quasi . . . . videtur] quasi and videtur are introduced into the clause

because the language is figurative and not strictly true. Comp. 4, 3.

Solum] Z. Gr. ἓ 68Ἷ.

 

 

In vitio] “In vitio esse dicitur, quod vitiosum est; ut in laude, quod ι

laudabile? Comp. 19, 1. 14, 3. 15, 3. Comp. Engl. in tlte wrony.

Deserat] The connection of tenses requires the present in Latin. The
English idiom does not admit it.

9. See Conspectus. Nocere] Z. Gr. ἓ 614.

10. Ayyrediuntur] Comp. 7, 1. nominantur. The subject is, in this case,
qualified by maximam partem„ Z. Gr. ξ 459.

ἓξ 9 and 10 contain the subdivision into two parts, of the first kind of
wrong mentioned in ἓ 'L The second of these subdivisions (ξ 10) Cicero
makes the subject of the next chapter as sar as ἓ 9, but only in a limited way,
by confining the discussion to avarice and ambition as examples of the whole.

Cn. VIII. Cicero gives four reasons for which men seek wealth, (1.) ad
uuo vitoe necessarios, (2.) ad perfruenda-3⁸ voluptates, (8.) ad opes et qrattfl·
