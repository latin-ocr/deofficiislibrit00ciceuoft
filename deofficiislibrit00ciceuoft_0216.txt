Quackenbos’s Text-Books.

The Publishers invite particular attention to the following School-books by Θ.
Ρ. ρσᾼοκεκεοε, A. M. They have stood the test of criticism, and have become ne-
knowledged standards on the subjecte os which they respectively trcat. The secret
of their success is their perfect adaptation in style, language and development of the
subjtect, to the pupil's comprehension. It is this that wins sor them a general intro-
duction, and makes them, when once introduced, special favorites with both tencher
and scholar.

This work is an eminently clear and praetieal text-book, and embraces a variety
os important subJects‚ which have a common connection and mutually illustrate each
other: but which the pupil has heretofore been obliged to leave unlearned, or to
search for among a number os different volumes. Claiming to give a comprehensive
and practical view os our language in all its relations, this “Advanced Course” views
it as a whole, no less than with reference to the individua] words composing it3 shows
how it compares with other tongues: points out its beauties; indicates how they
may best be made available2 and, in a word, teaches the student the most philoso-
phical method of digesting his thoughts, as well as the most effective mode of ex-
pressing them.

Hon. A. Cos-susum: BAnnv, State Superintendent of the common Schools of
wisconsin‚ in a Report to the Legislature of that State, uses the following strong
language in relation to Qchcmzxnos's works on Composition:—

“It would be difficult to point out in these admirable books any thing that wo
would desire to have altered; they meet our wants in every respect, making no un-
reasonable drast on the time or patience of the teacher, and leaving him no excuse
sor neglecting to make composition a regular study, even with his younger classes.
1t is unneoessary to compare these books with others on the subject, for ‘razna Amr
nom-2 'rtur APPROAcn 'mim in clearness, comprehensiveness, excellence of arrange-
ment, and above all, in direct practical bearinss. Affording an insight into the me-

chanism of 1anguage, they will hardly fail to impart facility and grace of expression,
and to inspire a love sor the beauties of literature.''

From Pssor. Jorm N. Pnur, osma University osAlabama.

I have been using Quncmzxssos on Composition and Rhetoric in the instruction
of my classes in the University, and 1 am persuaded of its canu· Excssumvcn. The
First Lessons in Composition, by the same author, 1 regard as very useful for be-
ginnere. Of these two books. I can speak with the greatest oonfidence, and 1 do
