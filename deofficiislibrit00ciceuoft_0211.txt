In compiling this grammar, Prof. ChampIin has drawn upon the best critics and
grammarians, and with the results of his research has interwoven much original mat-
ter suggested during several yesrs' experience in teaching, and editing Greek authors.
His design is to exhibit the essential facts and principles of the lsnguage in the clear-
est, briefest, and most practicablc form possible. With this view, all theories ond
complications belonging to general grammar have been avoided, and only their re-
sults used. The amplification and illustration of principles have been carried only
so far as is necessary to their comprehension. In this way all the real wants of the
Greek student are met, while his attention is not distracted by unnecessary and em-
barrassing details. Materials for oral exerciscs are supplied, and a sketch of Greek
versification is given in an appendix.

From the Rsv. Mn. Annnnson, New Orleans.

“1 believe the author has fully accomplished what he proposes in his preface.
To those wishing to study Greek, I am satisfied he has presented a book which will
much tend to simplisy the study to beginners—nnd at the same time, without being
too voluminous, presents as lucid and full an exposition of the principles of the lan·
guage, as can be contained within so small a compass.

Kuhner's is universally scknowledged to be thvmost accurate, comprehensive,
clear, and practical grammar or the Greek language now extant. It is the work of
one who devoted his life to Greek philology, and spent years of patient labor in
perfecting this work. 'roo full and learned for the beginner, it is just what is needed
{or the college curriculum, containing all that abook of reference should contain.
The student will never appeal to its pages in vein. In fulness of illustration, co-
piousness of reference, and philosophical analysis cf the various forms of language, it
is unsurpassed, we might say unequalled.

The present translation is made by two distinguished American scholars, who
heve revised the whole, verified the references, and appended an original treatise of
their own on Greek versification. As now presented to the public, lt is believed to
be n perfect a grammar 01 the Greek lsnguage as enlightened resesrch ond profound
ocholmhlp can produce.
