The text of this edition is mainly that os Orelli, the most important readings of
other critics neing given in scot-notes. Π The volume is introduced with a biographicnl
sketch of Horace and a critique on his writings, which enable the student to enter in-
telligently on his work. Peeuliar grammatical constructions, as well as geographical
and historical allusione, are explained in notes, which are just full enough to aid the
pupil, to excite him to gain a thorough understanding of the author, and awaken in
him a taste for philological studies, without taking all labor off his hands. While the
chief nim has been to impart a clear idea of Latin Syntax as exhibited in the text, it
has also been a eherished obJect to take advantage of the means so variously and richly
furnished by Horace for promoting the poetica] taste and literary culture of the
student.

From an article by Pssor. BAmz, of tlte Universz'ty oflIeidelberq, in the

“'I'here are already several American editions of Horace, intended sor the use οἰ
schools; οἰ one of these, which has passed through many editionS, and has also been
widely circulated in England‚ mention has been formerly made in this journnl; but
that one we may not put upon un equality with the one now before us, inasmuch as
this has taken a different stand-point, which may serve as a sign of prom-ess in this
department of study. The editor has, it is true, also intended his work for the use of
schools, and has sought to adapt it, in all its parts, to such a nse: but still, without los-
ing sight of this purpose, he has proeeeded throughout with more independence. In the

The editors have spent a vast amount of time and labor in correcting the text, by
a comparison of the most improved German and English editions. It iu'scsseved that
this will be found superior to any edition hitherto published in this country. In ac-
cortlance with their chronological order, the “ Jugu1·tha'' precedes the “ Catiline.”
The Notos ure copious and tei-sely expressed; they display not only flue scholarship‘
