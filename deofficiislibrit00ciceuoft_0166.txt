154 NOTE'S.

to separate. Est quod dzfferat, there is that which separates, or better, ther·
is a difference between, etc. Z. Gr. ἓ 561.

8. Non offendere] scil. eos. The object expressed with violare is under-
sbood in this clause. For offendo aliquem meanS, I offend one, I provoke
one's censure, while offendo or offendor in aliquo is understood in a neuter
or passive sense, to be offended, to find cause of qffenee. Z.

9. See Conspectus Ham primum habet viam] Vim is the reading in
the larger and smaller editions of Zumpt, but Orelli. Beier, Gernhard,
Degem and Bonnell retain viam, which is found in most of the MSS.—
Viam, quoe . . . . naturoe] path which lead-3 to harmony with, and preserva-
tion, i. e. faithful observanee, of nature. Sequemurque] Comp. 25, 4.

10. De qua disputamus] scil. temperantia.

11. The author goes on to show what it is to adapt the mental activity
to nature, to wit, that it is to render it subject to reason, since that is the
nature of man as distinguished from the beasts. The words vis and natura
frequently occur in connection in Cicero, and differ very little in meaning;

nature, beiny, constitution. Bonnell suggests that they be considered as

making a ease of Hendyadis, and translates : die naturliche Beschaffenheit.
Phe natural constitution os the mind. See Z.

 

Cn. XXIX. 1. Actio . . . . reddere] Bonnell gives very forcible reasons
for substituting ratio for actio, notwithstanding the authority of the MSS„
which Zumpt and Orelli have followed Zumpt, however, meets one ob-
jection by substituting possis for the usual reading, possit, and supplying
debes with ayere. Debes is, of course, suggested by the debet of the pre-
ceding clause. Hoec est . . . . officii] Comp. 3, 5.

2. Eamque . . . . praecurrant] Z. Gr. ἓ 386. Piqritz'am aut ignaviam]
Doderlein, speaking of the difference between these two words, says that
pimitia, which he connects with pinquis, springs from the physical temper-
ament, iynavia from the character.

3. Nam qui, ete] It is evident, from the expressions here used to
describe uncurbed desires, that the author is, in thought, comparing
them with untamed steeds. Comp. 26, 5. A quibu-3] Comp. 4, 1, a
natura.

4. Gestiunt] conduct extravayantly, are beside themselves. Comp. exul·
cantes, above, ἓ 3.

5. Ad officii formam] to a delineation, description of duty3 that is, to
the definite rules of duty, which are to be derived from this observation of
nature. Z.——- Ut ne] Comp. 20,12. Temere ae fortuato] In the for-
mer of these words, the idea of the thoughtless person is prominent, in the
latter the idea of chance, as the director of his actions. Comp. Tac. Germ.
10. See Conspectus.

ficulars are connected by et,· the subordinate by atque. Comp. 26. 6. Β
