'Man has his own regularly constituted nature. Au the faculties of his
being have certain tendencies. If this nature exist in its entire complete·
ness and extent, if all these tendencies are fully satisfied, then the man is
virtuous. All that such a man does is good, is κατόρθωμα, is perfect duty.
It may perhapS, in the eyes of the whole world, not be different from that
which the ordinary, or even the bad man does; it may perhaps, in relation
to the good of society, be of equal value, but within it has a spirit altogether
different—a different power. The one man works always with all the
faculties of a perfect soul, and these faculties in mutual union and in har-
mony. The other is, so to speak, called out and determined only by the
occasion. True virtue is an ever-buming fire, which produces of itself light
and heat. The virtue of the imperfect man is a light kindled for the oc-
casion, a warmth imparted for the moment.

An act may be adapted to circumstances and satisfy some xisible rela-
tions. It may benefit many and harm no one. And then the great portion
of mankind call it upright and ask nothing more. But the sharper eye of the
philosopher searches deeper. It sees a great difference between the man-
ner in which this act is performed by the wise man, on the one hand, and
by the common man on the other—by him whose character is thoroughly
and always upright, and by him who determines to do right this time in
view only of motives derived from present circumstances. From this comes
the Greek name given by the Stoics to such a duty, and their definition
which Cicero here introduces. They call such a duty καθῆκον, the suita-
hle, the fittiny, and define it as an act for which rational grounds can be
given.

The reflecting reader will be struck by this, and ask: Can there be a
higher goodness of actions, than that of having performed them according
to reason? “ Certainly not‚’' would the Stoic answer, “if it were the com-
pletely enlightened reason. The definition does not mean to say that the
duties commonly requi :ed and performed in human life, are altoyether in
accordance with reason, but that they can be justified. Moreover, in the
case of a perfect act, which we call κατόρθωμα, the whole of the conduct is
taken into view3 in the case of that which we call καθῆκον, only individual
aces, separate from the rest. Each act att-ains exact moral rectitude only
by its union with the whole life. The life of the wise man is a harmonious
whole; the life of the fool consists of fragments. There are times when
the latter has become attentive to circumstances, and has found out what
· he ought to do, and there are times when he has only followed his undis-
ciplined nature. The wise man ever acts according to character, and this
is good. Duties of the inferior sort are performed rather from a considera-
tion of circumstances; duties of the higher kind, from the innei impulsos
of the soul.”

It is now easy to understand, that according to these ideas, the Stoics
were obliged to consider all perfect duties equal, and to allow no degi-ees
