2. Epulis, et viscerationibus] In addition to the feasts which individuale
used to give their friends on great occasions, such as a triumph, an election
to an important office, or the bun'al of a distinguished citizen, there was a
distribution of cooked or raw meat to the people called visceratio, and
sometimes a public banquet. Such public banquets are alluded to in the word
epulis, as we may inser from the context. See Smith’s Dict. Antiq„ Funus.

timent quoted is not found in his writings, and it is thought to be incon-
sistent with the opinions found in his works. (See Ethic. Nicomach. 4, 1, 2.)
Orelli however retains the manuscript reading, and refers to Cic. de N at.
Deor. ΙΙ, 37, 95, for evidence that Aristotle may have held what is here
ascribed to him. See B. and Z.

mur.” In quo . . . . ipso] = in qua re ipsa. See Z.

. . . . munere] Festus (p. 140, ed. Muli) says: Munus siymficat officium,
quum dicitur quis munere junqi. Item donum, quod officii causa datur.
Thisexplains the twofold, varying signification of this word in the passage
under consideration, and in ξ 12; 17, 6; 18, 9; 20, 7, its meaning being at
one time, office, service ,· at another, the plays which the aediles are accus-
tomed to furnish to the people. Comp. 21, 11. B. 0. Claudius] He
is said to have been the first who exhibited a fight between elephants in

(Β. c. 55) gave the most magnificent exhibitions that had ever been seen in

elephants were collected for the combat of beasts. By the use of nostri,
g Cicero indicates his attachment to Pompey. Comp. 17, 10. B.
