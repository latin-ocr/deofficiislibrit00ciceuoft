The present work is what its title indicates, strictly au Ollendorffi and aims to
npply the methods which have proved so successful in the acquisition of the modern
languagcs to the study of Anciont Greek, with such differences as the different genius
of the Greek, and the different purposes sor which it is studied‚ suggest. It differs
from the modern Ollendorffs in containing exercises for reciprocal translation, in
confining them within a smallcr compass, and in a more methodical exposition of the
principles of the langnage.

The leading object of the author was to furnish a book which should serve as an
introduc-tion to the study of Greek, and precede the use of any grammar. It will
therefore be found, although not claiming to embrace all the principles of the Gram-
mar, yet complete in itself, und will lead the pupss, by inscnsible gradations, from the
simplet constructions to those which are more complicated and difficult. The excep-
tions, and the more idiomatic forms, it studiously avoids. aiming only to exhibit tho
regular and ordinary usages of the language as the proper starting-point sor the stu-
dent‘s further researches.

In presenting these, the author has aimcd to combine the strictest accuracy with
the utmost simplicity of statement. His work is therefore adapted to a younger class
of pupils than have usually engaged in the study of Greek, and will, it is hoped, win
to the acquisition of that noble tongue many in our academies and primax-y schools
who have been renoned by the less simple character of our ordinary text-books.

These Exerciscs consist of easy sentences, similar to those in the Anabasis,in
having the same words and constructions, and are designed by frequent repetition to
make the lcarner familiar with the language of Xenophon. Accordingly, the chap-
ters and sections in both are made to correspond. No exercises can be more improv-
ing than those in this volume: obliging the student as they d0‚ by analysis and syn-
thesis, to master the constructione employed by one of the purest of Greek writers.
sud imbuing him with the spirit of one of ther greatest historiens of all antiquity.
