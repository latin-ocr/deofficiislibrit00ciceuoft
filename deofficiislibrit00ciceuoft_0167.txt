Lm. 1. cAP. xxx. 155

’1. Illo quidem] Comp. 18, 4. 27, 9., and Madvig, ἓ 480, b. Quieta-
lm] Comp. 22, 15. and Z. Gr. ἓ 92. The plural of quies occurs also in
Sallust, catil„ 15, 4.

8. Profusum] exeessive. Ingenuum] such as is found among free-born
men. Comp. in 27, 12, liberali, which has a similar meaning.

9. Honestatis actionibus] honestatis is not a genitive of quality. See Z.
Gr. g 426.

10. I lliberale] The opposite of inqenuum, ἓ 8.—Illib ..... flayitio-
sum] unqenteel, rude, base.

Plautus . . . . eomoedia] The old comedy brought out real actions and
living personages for public ridicule, as Aristophanes, the only one belong-

 

 

' ing to this school whose writings survive, ridiculed Socrates and his philos-

ophy in his “ Clouds.” Cicero's opinion of the elegance and refinement of
the jests of Plautus and Aristophanes will hardly be agreed to by 111 their
readers. See Horace, Ars. P. 270, seqq. B.

12. Tempore] i. e. suo, justo tempore. Z. Remisso] =otioso, the op-

 

posite of intento. Libero, which is wanting in this clause in the editions of
Heusinger, Beier, Degen, Bonnell‚ Gernhard. Orelli, and others, is inserted
by Zumpt, after homine—remisso homine libero-on the authority of one
MS„ as he thinks it necessary, in order that there fnay be a transition from
remisso homine libero to libero merely. The context, however, does not
seem to require any other thought than that which is naturally expressed
by the text as it stands, if we translate libero, (alter ne libero quidem)
free-spoken. Comp. Hor. Sat. 1, 3, 52. At est truculentior atquc Plus
aequo liber?
14. Campus] scil. Martius.

3. Sed si quis . . . . erectior] Respecting sed, see Z. Gr. ἓ 739. It has
reference, however, to the clause modo ne . . . . yenere. Eroetior, a little
more elevated, i. e. in character. Garve translates thus: if he but have
a little elevation of soul.

From which is derived the rational metkod os finding! out what is our duty.
For we find out what duty is, by reflecting how much and in what respects
human nature is superior to that of beasts. Z. With this paragraph
comp. 28, 3. ,

8. Ut enim, etc] Cicero, having asserted that we have a character as
human beings‚ and a character as individuah, proceeds to illustrate by ex-
amples the diversity of individual character. His examples, as Heusinger
says, are wont to be cited from among those whom he has seen, but who
uo longer survive.
