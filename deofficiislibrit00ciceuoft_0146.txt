proper subject of his treatise, to wit, a discussion of common duties,
καθήκοντα, and occupies the remainder of this section in enumerating the
several divisions into which his subject naturally falls. We have, therefore,
in this passage, an epitome of the whole work. First book, chapters 4—42
de honesto ; 43 to end of book, de comparatione honestorum ; second book,
1—24‚ de utili ; 25, de comparatione utilium ; third book, αὶ contentione hon-

Comp. Z. For use of plural, Z. Gr. ἓ 92.

Opes] Z. translates influence—the influence which is derived from friends
and dependants. Comp. 32, 2., where divitiae and opes occur in connection
and cannot therefore mean the same thing. B. on 25, 4.

Rationem utilitatis] the cateqory of expediency.

Possint] An indicative here would take the clause out of its connection
with conducat, and make it a direct assertion.

8. Dubitandi] See ἓ 6.

9. Duo praetermissa sunt] scil. α Panaetio.

10. Primum . . . . disserendum] See ἓ 6.
