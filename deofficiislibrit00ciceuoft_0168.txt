9. Maqisque de imhstria] It Crassus and Philippus it was more a
natural endowment, in Caesar the result of study. Concerning this Caesar⁴
whose cognomen was Strabo, see Cic. Brutus, cap. 48. Philippus is spoken
of in the same work, cap. 47, and Scaurus cap. 29. M Druso adoles-
cente] Probably M. Livius Drusus, who was an opponent of O. Gracchus.
In Cic. Brut. he is called vir et oratione yravis et auctoritate. In ejus . .
tristior] This clause Garve freely translates thus: his friend Scipio, on
the other hand, was more occupied with the projects of his ambition, and
loss interested in the pleasures of society.

10. Atque . . . . simulatorem] He was accustomed to pretend ignoranoe,
aqens imperitum et admiratorem aliorum tanquam sapieniam. Quintil.
IX, 2, 46.

11. Callidum Hannibalem . . . . accepimus facile celare, etc] accepimus
is the perfect definite, and is nevertheless connected with the present infini-
tive in a narrative of what is past. Z. Gr. ξ 589. Bonnell suggests,
although he does not prefer, another construction, which, after a Greek
analogy, makes the infinitives depend on callidum. Prceripere] is a
stronger expression than proecz'pere, which is the reading of some editions,
but rests on inferior authority.

12. In quo genere] In which department, to wit, of arts or accomplish-
ments. Vita ejus] Usage would require sua, for which the writer, as
if having forgotten, for the moment, that the subordinate clause expressed
the sentiment of the leading subject of the sentence, qui . . . . simulavit,
substituted ejus. Madvig (ξ 481, note 3.) attributes this deviation from

 

 

 

 

regularity to a want of care. He asserts, however, that it never occurs in
the case of a subj. acc. with an infinitiva immediately connected with the
leading verb. For instance, eum would never be found in the place of se,-
in such a sentence as furere se simulavit. Comp. Z. Gr. ξ 550, and Neue
Jahrb. Aliquanto] Comp. 1, 2. 23, 6.

13. Multum dispares] Comp. ἓ 1 111 this chap. and 21, 8. Ζ. Gr. ἓ 488.
Tischer asserts, (Neue J ahrb.‚) that par and dispar are always connected
with the dative, except in the two passages cited by Zumpt, in his Gram-
mar, g 411.——Sunt . . . . qui . . . . putant] The use of the indicative in
the relative clause shows that the subjectos sunt is not indefinite in the

” mmd of Cicero. De insidiis] Heusinger says: De h. L locale est. It
does not, therefore, differ essentially from ex, on which occulto depende.
Comp. de transverso, de ter90.Heus's1nger adds: solent optimi scriptores
variare praepositiones Τ11113 Liv. 42 ‚.;.²4 Ob nullam aliam causam 11131

14. Callicratidam] See 24, 9.

15. Alium . . . . efficere] scil. accepimua— Unus de multis] one of the
δι πολλοὶ. Q. Mucio Mancia] It is not known who Mucius Mancia. was.
