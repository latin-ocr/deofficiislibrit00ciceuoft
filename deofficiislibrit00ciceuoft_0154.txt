Z. Gr. ξ 771.

5. Nollem Corinthum] sc. sublatam esse. Z. Gr. ἓ 528, note 2

Aliquid secutos] that they had smnethiny in view, and so were not
prompted by cruelty.

6. Quae habitura sit] Observe the difference made by using the sub-
junctive instead of habitura est in this clause. See Z. Gr. ἓ 558.

In quo si mihi esset obtemperatum] Cicero here refers to his fruitless
efforts to prevent civil war, by restoring harmony between Caesm- and
Pompey. Τὴε sentence contains only a side thought.

’7. oum . . . . tum] See 5, 5. Confuyient] Observe this idiomatic
and frequent use of the future instead of the pres. subj. in intel-mediate rel-
ative clauses, which contain the enunciation of precepts and laws. Comp.
14,2 and 103 25,8; 38‚2; 40, 2; 41,9 and12;42,10. Β.

Quamvis murum arzes perevaserit] It was a custom of the Romans
having well nigh the force of a law, to spare the enemies who surrendered
before the battering-ram was applied to the walls. Comp. Grotius de jure

11. Scripsit ut . . . . obliyet] The tense to be expected here was oblique
ret. But the writer turns, although in the oratio obliqua, to an imperative
tone, as it were. A similar violation of the usual rules for the connection of
tenses, is found Sall. Cat. 34. Respondit, si quid ab senatu petere v elle π t,
ab armis discedant. Z. Gr. ἓ 512.

12. Cum in Macedonia . . . . esset] The clause in brackets is rejected by
Zumpt, on the ground of the improbability that the son of Cato should have
been discharged by Popilius, and. again, five years later, by AEmih'us Paullus,
with whom it is not denied that he served as a soldier in the war with
Perses. He would therefore refer the statements of ἓ 12 to the occasion
nefore alluded to. =
