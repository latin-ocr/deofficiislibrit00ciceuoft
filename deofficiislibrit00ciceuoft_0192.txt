4. Externmm] Similarity of construction would have required externa
inter se hoc modo comparantur. But for the sake of brevity the construo-
tion is changed. Heusinger makes externorum depend on numero under-
stood, (e numero.) According to Bonnell it depends on ⁸«floria and νει-εἰρα-
lia. For a construction like the latter, compare Tac. Germ. 9: Deorum
maxime Mercurium colunt ; Tac. Hist. Ι, 31: Tribunorum Subrium et Ce-
rium milites adorti ,· Hist. II, 15: quorum improvide secutos equites cir-
cumvenerunt. Vectiyalia] This word here meane, private income ,-
vectiqalia urbana, imomefrom possessione in the city.

5. Pascere] The raisiny of cattle. Quid fenerari ..... occidere]
Compare what Cicero says of usurers, Ι, 42, 2.

’1. Optimis viris] This expression is evidently ironieaL—Ad Janum
medium] Janus summus, Janus medius, and Janus imus are mentioned
by Latin writers. Beier holds that the two sides of the Forum Romanum,
along which were ranged the tabemae, shOPS, and places of business, were
called Janus medius; while the end nearest the Capitol was called «Ianus
summus; and the remote end, Janus imus. Zumpt, on the other hand,
maintains that they wera three over-built passages to the forum, where
the usurers and gold and⁴ silver smiths had their plaoes of business.
