Aristo of Chios, and Herillus of Carthage were Stoics; Pyrrho was the
founder of the sect of the Skeptics. They agreed in considering all exter-
nal things indifferent—in denying that they should be reckoned among
things good or evil. 1. Pyrrho taught this by denying all grounds of truth.
For, if in the case of our objects of thought there is never any reason for
considering them, or any one of them, true rather than false, then of course
there is never any true ground for asserting that any external object is
good, or a proper object of desire or preference. “Pyrrho is said to be the
originator of the doctrine that there is no difference between health and
sickness, life and death.”

2. Aristo, like Hermus, deviated from Zeno, their common teacher and
the founder of their sect. He rejected all parts of philosophy except ethice,
and even limited the domain of ethics itselss for he taught that its object
is not to treat of particular duties and encouragements to virtue, but that
it is the province of the philosopher to show wherein the supreme good
consists. “ With Aristo, naught is of worth but virtue, nothing is evil but
vice. He seeks to refute the opinion that there is such a difference in ex·
ternal things that one is preferable to another.'’

3. Herillus limits the virtue of the sage to science and knowledge. He
considers practical life, which is occupied about external things, as simply
necessary, and denies it to be beautiful, on ‘the ground that it does not
contribute aught to the supreme good.

This principle, common to these three philosophers‚ strikes at the root
d practical morality. For if life is not preferable to death, health to sick-
