Annum jam audientem] Cicero sent his son to Athens about the first
of April, Β. C. 45, as we learn from a letter written by him to Atticus the

, next year, (Ep. ad Atticum XV. 15‚) in which, speaking of his son, he says:

scripsit, sibi, post Kal. April—sic enim omnum tempus confici—nihil da.-
tum esse. As he says in the text that his son has been hearing Cratippus
a year, it is inserted that Cicero began this treatise in the spring, or early
in the summer 44 B. O„ two or three months at most after the assassina-
tion of Oaesar.

On the other hand, the following reasons may be given for believing that
the treatise was not commenced till the autumn of the same year: 1. Iu
the very frequent letters of this period, which give us almost the daily oc-
cupations of Cicero, there is no mention of a work de Officiis till Oct. 24,
(Ep. ad Att. XV. 13.) 2. Cicero implies (de Off. III. 33) that this book
was intended as a substitute for the instruction which he had designed
giving his son in person at Athens. It may be supposed, therefore, that it
was written after the project of visiting Graece was abandoned. He in-
forms us (Ep. ad Att. XVI. 7) that having set out on the voyage, he was
driven back to the vicinity of Rhegium on the sixth of August, and was
induced to give up his visit to his son, and return to Rome, by the repre-
sentations of his friends that a favorable change in public affairs had taken
place, and that his presence was demanded. He reached the capital the
last day os August, and having, on the second of September, delivered his
first Philippic, retired soon after to his country-seat Puteolanum. Here ho
spent the months of October and November, and is supposed to have cm-
ployed himself in writing this work. It is agreed that it was finished be-
fore the ninth of December.

A. W. Zumpt suggests that the disagreement here set forth may be
reconciled by supposing that the young Cicero, although he left home the
first of April, did not for some time actually commence his attendance
