6, 7. ,Princepsque . . . . esse maximum] Garve remarks, not without rea-
son, that Cicero’s second metaphysical reason at the first glance seems tc
lead to the opposite of that which he wishes to prove. ‘⁴ It seems absurd,
that, because a certain kind of wisdom is the first of all virtues, therefore
the effort to obtain wisdom is not the first of all duties. The opposite con-
clusion appears the most natural. If the knowledge of the nature of God
and man is the highest perfectiom then, to be sure, the endeavor to secure
this knowledge, and consequently the investigation of nature, must be the
first duty. Cicero nevertheless hits upon a mean, by which he unites the
two propositions apparently so contradictory. This wisdom, which is the
highest virtue of man, is the knowledge of the relations in which he stands3
and these relations, so far as he can survey them, are no other than those
in which he stands to God aud his feHow·men.” Anmerkungen, 1, 212.
See Bonnell. Zumpt agrees with Garve in referring ea to sapientia, thus
differing from Heusinger, who refers it to societas. See Garve’s Abhandl.

10. Cupidus in perspicienda . . . . natura] The more common construc-

 

tion would be cupidus perspiciendoe naturoe. But cupidus is here used ab·

4. Ut otium, etc.] Bonnell finds here a play on the words otium and
neqotium = nec otium.

6. Coyz'tatio in se ipsa vertitur] Bonnell is in doubt whether se is in
the ablative, which case is often connected with verti when used in a mid-
dle sense, or in the accusative. He adds, that the sense will be the same
with either construction. Heusinger considers se accusative.
