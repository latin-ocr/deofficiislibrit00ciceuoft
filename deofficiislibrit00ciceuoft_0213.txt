In the preparation of this volume, great care has been taken to adapt it in every
respectto the wants of the young student, to make it 0 means at the same time ot
advsncing him in 11 thorough knowledge of Latin, and inspiring him with 11, desire
sor further acquaintance with the classics os the language. Dr. Spencer has not, like
some commentatore, given 011 01111οᾶ0000 of help on the easy passages, and allowed
the difficult ones to speak sor themselves. His notes 1110 011 those parts on which
the pupil wants them, and explain, not only grammatical difficulties, but allusione of
every kind iu the text. A well-drawn sketch of Cae-sar's life, a map of the region in
which his campaigns were carried on, and 0 Vocabulary, which removes the neces-
sity of using a large dictionary and the waste or time consequent 11101οο11, 0111101100

Curtius* History os Alexander the Great, though little used in the schools of
this country, in England and on the Continent holds 0 high place in the estimatmn
of classical instructors. The interesting character of its 011113οο1, the elegauce os its
style, and the purity οἰ its 1110101 sentiments‚ ought to place it at least on 0 par with
Caessr's Commentaries or Sallust's Histories. Tho present edition, by the late Pro-
fessor of Latin in Rutgcrs CoHege, is unexceptionable iu typography‚ convenient 111
form, scholar-ly and practical in its notes, and altogether 1111 admirable text-book sor
classes preparing for college.
