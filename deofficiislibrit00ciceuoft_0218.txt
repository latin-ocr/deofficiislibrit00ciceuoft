'Tacitus‘s account of Germany and life of Agricola are among the most fascinating
and instruetive Latin classics. The present edition has been prepared cxpressly for
college classes, by one who knows what they need⁴ In it will be found: 1. A Latin
text, approved by all the more recent editors. 2. A copious illustration of the gram-
matical constructions, as well as of the rhetorical and poetical usages peculiar to
Tacitus. In a writer so concise it has been dec-med necessary to pay particular re-
gard to the connection of thought, and to the particles as the hinges of that connec-
tion. 3. Constant compar-isone οἰ the writer with the authors of the Augustan age,
sor the purpose of indicating the changes which had already been wrought in the
languagc of the Roman people. 4. An embodiment in small compass of the most val·
uable labors os such recent German critics as Grimm, Giinther, Grnber, Kiessling‚
Dronke, Roth, Ruperti, and Walther.

From Paor. Lmeozx, ofBrown Um‘cerez‘ty.

¹⁴1 have found the book in daily use with my class of very great service, very

fflctical, and well suited to the wants or students. I am very much pleased with the

' e of Tacitus and the Introduction, and indeed with the literar-y character of the
book throughout. We shall multe the book a part of our Latin course.”

The text of Tacitus is here presented in a form as correct aa a comparison of the
best editions can make it. Notes are'appended for the stridenes use, which contain
not only the grammatical, but likewise all the geographica, archaeological, and his-
ἴοι-1031 illustrations that are necessary to render the author intelligible. It has been
the constant aim of the editor to carry students beyond the dry details os grammar
and lexicography, and introduce them to afamiliar acquaintance and lively sympathy
with the author and his times. Indexes to the notes, and to the names of persons and
places, render reference easy.

From Pnor. Hac-mr, qf Newum sseolooical Sminary.

“The notes appear to me to be even more neat and elegant thau those on the
⁸ Germania and Agricola' They come as near to euch notes as 1 would be glad to
write myselr on a classic, ae almost any thing that 1 have yet seen?
