11. Omnis autem . . . . castigat] Punitur refers to animadversio ; ver-
bis castiyat‚ to castiyatz'o. B. Castiyare‚ however, is not always limited
in its signification to a verbal infliction. Comp. Tusc. Disp.111, 2-7. Pueros

verberibus. Punitwr] See Z. Gr. ξ 206, end.

13. Modo ne laudarent] “ By means of the partiales dum, dummodo, or
simply modo, ²f only, provided only, ( [or negatively] dum ne, dummodo ne,

8. See Conspectus. Illud] is placed in contrast with hoec of the pre-
ceding sentence. Cicero here returns to the proposition which he laid down
in cap. 21, respecting men in public life, and then closes the discussion of
the third of the cardinal virtues with a few words on the magnitudo animi
in vita otiosa. Maximi animi] Genitive of quality. It takes the place
of an adjective agreeing with res as maximas does. So mayni animi of the
next sentence qualifies multos.

Cn. XXVII. See Conspectus. 1. De una reliqua parte honestatis] By
the reliqua pars honestatis, Cicero means the σωφροσύνη, of the Greeks, but
finding no Latin word which expresses the fun meaning of the Greek, he pro-
ceeds according ‘oo the rule laid down de Fin. ΠΙ, 33, 4. Equidem soleo
etiam, quod uno (ἔπεστ’, si aliter non possum, idem pluribus verbis exponere.
