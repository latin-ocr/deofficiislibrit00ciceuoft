Tho present selection embraces such parts of Herodotus as give a connected his·
§oxy of Asiatie nations. These portions are not only particularly interesting in
themselves, but open to the student a new field, inasmuch as the other Greek and
Roman authors commonly put into his hands leave this period of history untouchcd.

Herodotus is peculiarly adapted to academical reading. It has. charnis for tho
student which no othei· text-book possesses, on account of the simple elegance of the
style and the liveliness or the narrative. In preparing his notes, the editor has borne
ln mind that they are intended sur lcarners in the earlier part of their classica!
course ς he has therefore made the explanations in the former part of the work quite
full. with frequent references to such grammars as are in the hands os most studonts.

The notes proper are purely explanatory and grammatical. Other remarks, in
the way of critic-ism or investigation‚ are appended to the several chapters‚ for the
sake of awakening reflection and inciting to further inquiry.

A condensed treatise on the Ionio Dialeon and the peculiar forms of declension
and conjugation used by Herodotus, removes one of the most serious difficulties that
has heretosoro embarrassed the student in reading this author. 11· this chapter is
learned in admnoe, the dialectic forms, otherwise so troublesomc, will be recognized
without the slightest difficulty.

The text is printed in large, bold type, and accompanied with a Map os tho regions
described.

The obiect had in view in this publication is to surnish to college· students tho
masterpiece of the greatest of Greek tragic poete in a convenient form. No learned
critic-ism on the text was needed or has been attempted. The Tauchnitz edition has
been chiefly followed, and such aid is rendered, in the way of* notes, as may sssist,
not render noemam, the efforts oi* the student. Too much help begets indolence.
too little despair: the author has striven to present the happy mean.

The inviting appearance of the text and the merit of the commentary have meda
thia volume a. favor-ite wherever it has been used.
