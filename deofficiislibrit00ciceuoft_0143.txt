ness, the possession of property to the want of it, then the murderer, the
man of violence, and the robber‚ do no wrong. On the other hand, the
Stoica, while they maintained that virtue alone was to be sought forits own
sake, nevertheless conceded that external things, although none of them
could be called a genuine good or a real evil, were yet valuable, and that
different external things differed in value‚ and might be prefen‘ed one to
another. Oomp. Ritter’s Hist. Anc. Philosophy, translated by Mor-rison,

Hoc quidem tempore] For Cicero, although an eclectio, was rather in-
clined to the philosophy of the N ew Academy than to that of the Stoics.

12. A ratione] Zumpt, personifying ratio, makes this the ablative of the
voluntary agent. Gemhard, like Zumpt, makes the clause equivalent to
quam ratio suscipit. Beier omits the proposition. Bonnell retains a with .
its common signification, and translates: vom Wesen der Sache ausgehend,
prooeeding from. Goerenz gives it the signification which it has in such
phrases as ab Ῐιαο parte, a qua parte. It may be translated as follows:
all teachiny (literally, every qiviny of instruction) which is methodically
undertaken ouylit, etc„ which is substantially the rendering of A. W.
Zumpt.

Cn. ΙΙΙ. 1. sse whole investigation of duty consists of two main divis-

4. Alia divisio] It will appear below that this division coincides essen-
tially with the other.

The Stoics divide duties (τὰ καθήκοντα, officia) first into perfect, (ζέλειαρῐ
κατορθώματα, in Cicero, perfectum officium or rectum) secondly, into middle
(μέσα, or, without qualification, καθήκοντα, in Cicero media officia, or merely
officia.) A. W. Zumpt.

Vocem‘us] Z. Gr. ξ 527.

Hoc autem commune officium vocant] Most editors insert καθῆκον, after
officium. Heusinger and Zumpt reject it as wanting authority, and make
officium, the corresponding Latin word, its substitute. But iliis common
(duty, i. e., that which men commonly mean when they speak of duty‚)
they call officium. Heusinger, however, refers hoc to medium officium above,
and connects commune with officium in the predicate, the expression being
then equivalent to μέσον καθῆκον. The following remarks, translated and
much condensed from Garve, (Anmerkungen, p. 9, seqq.) are thr-own in
