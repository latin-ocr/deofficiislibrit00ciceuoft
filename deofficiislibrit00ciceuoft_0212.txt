A complete, thorough‚ pmctical, and easy Greek course is here presented. The
beginner commences with the “First Book? in which the elementary principles o!
the langnage are unrolded, notin abstract language, difficult both to comprehend and
to remember, but as practically applied in sentences- Throughout the whole, tho
pupil seesjust where he stands, and is taught to use and apply what he learns. His
progress is, therefore, as rapid as it is intelligent and pleasant. There is no unneces-
sary verbiage, nor is the pupil's attention diverted from what is really important by
a mass of minor details. It is the experience of teachers who use this book, that with
it a given amount of Greek Grammnr can be imparted to a pupil in a shorter time
end with far less trouble than with any other text—book.

The “First Book ” may with advantage be followed by the “Introduction to
Greek Prose Composition.” The object of this work is to enable the student, as soon
as he can decline and conjugato with tolerable facility, to translate simple sentences
mer given examples and with given words3 the principles employed being those of
imitation and very frequent re tition. It is at once a Syntax, a Vocabulary, and an
Exercise book. The “Second art '³ carries the subJect further, unfolding the most
complicated construetions, and the nicest points of Latin Syntax. A Key is provided
for the teacher's use.

The ‘⁴ Reader,” besides extracts judiciously selected from the Greek classics‚ con-
»ains valuable instructions to guide the learner in translating and construing, and a
complete exposition of the particles, their signification and government. It is a flt⁴
ting scquel to the earlier parts of the course, everywhere showing the hand of an
acute critic, an accomplished scholar, and an experienced teacher.

From the an. Du. comum, Professor os Greek and Latin, Ρνίηεειοη, N. J.

“ Ι ean, from the most satisfactory experience, bear testimony to the excellence
‘f our series of Text-Books for Schools. 1 am in the daily use of Arnold‘s Latin
5ηέ Greek Exercises, and consider them decidedly superior to any other Elementa-y
Works in those Languages.”
