'I'his edition of Cicero's Sclect orations possesses some special advantages for the
student which are both new and important. It is the only edition which contains
the improved text that has been prepared by a recent eareful collation and correct
deciphering of the best manuscripts of Cicero's writings. It is the work of the cele·
brated Orelli, Madvig, and Klotz, and has been done since the appearance of Orelli’s
complete edition. Tho Notes, by Professor Johnson, of the New York University,
have been mostly selected, with great care, from the best German authors, as well aa
the English edition ofArnold.

From Tuoms Cassa, Tutor· in Latin in Harvard University.

“An edition of Cicero like Johnson's has long been wanted; and the excellence
of the text, the illustrations of words, particles, and pronounS, and the explanation
os various points of construction and interpretation, bear witness to the Editor's
familiarity with some oi· the most important results of modern scholarship, and en-
title his work to a large share of public savor.''

“It seems to us an improvement upon any edition of these orations that has
been published in this country. and will be found a valuable aid in their studies to
the lovers of classical literature.''— Troy Daily Wleiq,

In this edition, a few historical notes have been introduced in cases where tte
Dictlonary ln common use have not been found to contain tho desired informat10n3
the design 01 which is to aid the learner in understanding the contents of the trea-
tises, the thoughts and reasoning os the author, to explain grammatical difficulties, and
inculcate a knowledge of grammatical principles. The Editor has aimed throughout
to gulde rather than carry the loarner through difficulties: requiring of him more
utudy‚ 111 consequence ol* his help, than he would have devoted to the book without it.

‘⁸ 1 have examined with much pleasuro Prof. Thacher's edition of Cicero do
Officiis, and am convinced or its excellence. The Notes have been prepared with
great care and good jndgment. Praeticnl knowledge of the wants of the. student has
enabled the Editor to furnish just the kind os assistanec required: gmmmatieal ‹litli-
culties are removed, and the obscurities of the treatise are explained, the interest of
the lem-ner is elicIted, and his industry directed rather than superseded. There can
be but one o lnlon with regard to the merits os tho work, and 1 trust that Professor
Thacher wll be die osed to continue hls labora so carerully commenced, in thia do-
pertinent of classi lcarnlng.”
