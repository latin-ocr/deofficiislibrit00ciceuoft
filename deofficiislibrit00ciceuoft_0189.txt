enacted that corn should be sold by the state to the people once a month,
at five-sixths of an as for each modius. See Smith’s Dict. Antiq„ Sempro-

when the Roman treasury was filled with the wealth aecruing from con-
quests and from the provinces, the Roman citizens were exempted from
paying the tributum3 and this state of things lasted down to the consul-
ship of Hirtius and Pansa, (n. c. 43,) the year aster Cicero wrote this book.
See Smith’s Dict. Antiq„ Tributum. Comp. 22, 2.

11. Malo . . . . disputo] The first part. of the parenthesis—malo . . . ,
ominari—refers to alicui rei publicae; in the second part he recalls the
words which he has just uttered, as uncajled for, because he is speaking οι
the state in general, and not of any state in particular.
