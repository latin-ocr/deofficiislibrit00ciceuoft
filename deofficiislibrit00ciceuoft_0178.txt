SECOND BOOK.

Cn. Ι. See Conspectus.

1. Ducerentur] The English idiom would prefer the present tenso.
Comp. Madvig, ἓ 383.

2. Vitae cultum] The duties which have an influence to promote our
welfare in respect to external things. B. Heusinger says of the phrase:
this is a description of the utility which is the subject of the book—Fa- ·
cultatem] Compare I, 3, 7. Zumpt, in a note on the passage under oon-
sideration‚ translates facultatem, possession and use. Cicero himself (de
Invent. I, 27, end) defines this word thus: Facultates sunt, aut quibus fa-
cilius fit, aut sinc quibus aliquid confici ‘non potest. B. This would be a
definition of the English word means, Opes] power, influence. Opes
has in view the facility of accomplishing what you wish through others. Z.
Copiae] wealtlz. In quo . . . . utile] refers to ut Icaec . . . . persequar.
Tum quoerz', etc] Tum properly belongs to the next clause, thus:
tum quid utile. Dixi] See I, 3, 7, and 9. De instituto] i. e. cur ad
hoc nos studium potissimum contulerimus. Beier. De judicio meo] i. e.
de nostra sententia ; (le philosophia nobis potissimum probata. Beier.

3. Bonis viris] Zumpt thinks that these words express a little irony,

but Bonnell objects to that interpretation. It is well known that philoso-
phy had to struggle for admission to Rome3 that, so late as the middle of
the second century before the Christian era, Carneades, DiogeneS, and Cri-
tolaus were, by a decree of the senate, driven out of the city, because they
taught the Greek philosophy there. See Aul. Gellius, Noct. Att. XV, 11
The prejudicc against such studies gradually gave way, but had not en—
tirely disappcared in the times of Cicero.

5. Nec rursum] nor οη the other hand.

7. Actiones] public speechcs, pleadinys, in the next sentence called licte-
rae forenses et senatori τ.

Cn. Π. 1. Videntur] scil. nobis. Z. Gr. ξ 380, end. Mandaremus]
The tense of the subjunctive is in this sentence affected by the preceding
perfect infinitive, assecuti. Comp. B.

3. Nec quicquam . . . . proeter, etc] Praeter is thus found in the place
of nisi after a negative. Neue J ahr. Bd 55, S. 289.

5. Sive ratio constantiae virtutisque ducitur] Rationem alicujus ducere
nihil aliud est quam rationem hahere, id non negligere, ei consulere. Heu-
singer. Constantia = moral consistency. Ars] For this word Cicero
substitutes disciplina and discendi ¹zymus in ἓ 7.
