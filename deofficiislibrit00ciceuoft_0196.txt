184 sorus.

Cn. VI. 1. Erqo unum . . . . propositum, ut] Bonnell says that this is
not the statement of an abstract proposition, but of life’s problem for all,
and for that reason we have ut with the subjunctive instead of the accusa-
tive and infinitive, just as in the next ἓ we have praescribit, ut ; and in ἓ 9,
nt violem.

2. Omnium utilitatem esse communem] we are all interested in the 9⁰⁰⁰
ο all.
s3. Verum autem . . . . extremum] As Bonnell remarks, the conclusion
might have been deduced immediately from the first proposition, ἓ 2: si
Ῐιοσ natura praescribit, etc.

7. Quae vacent injustitia] Comp. Ι, ’7, 2; 111, 19, 4. B.

8. Haec . . . . virtus] scil. justitia, which is easily supplied from the pre-
ceding sentence3 as Zumpt says: e vacatione injustitiae cogitatur justitia.
It should be remarked, however, that Orelli and Bonnell have quae non
vacent justitia, instead of the reading of Heusinger and Zumpt. The text
is very doubtful. Heusinger says: Quid Cicero velit, apparet3 quid scrip·
serit incertum est.

10. Phalarim] See 11, 7, 16.

11. Ab homine . . . . detraxeris] We have in this Section detrahere with
ab ,· with de, §g 12, 14; with the dative, ἓξ 4, 7. B. It will be readily
observed that important clauses of this sentence are utilitatis tuae causa,
and ob eam causam.

13. Aut quid ejusmodi] Quid instead of aliquid. Z. Gr. ἓ 708.
Derelictio] Bonnell says that this is the only place where this word is
found.

14. De se bene existimans seseque diligens] out of sels-esteem and sels-
love. Compare 33, 12 : seientiam suppeditantem voluptates, depellentem
dolores. Observe how the doctrine of this ἓ is also qualified by ἓ 11.
Comp. B.

15. Ita semper, etc.] In this way, that is, by always adhering to the
principles here suggested, he will discharge his duty.

16. Et potius] After a negative, the copulative conjunctions may have
an adversative force. Comp. atque after neque in this same sentence.

19. Ex tempore] According] to circumstances. See 4, 11.

 

CH. VII. The soregoing chapters are in form introductory, and yet they
mutam the essence of Cicero’s ideas on the subject of this book. That
which follows seems to consist of repetitions and illustrations of those ideas.
Garve.

1 Aliqui casus] Z. Gr. ἓ 135.

2. Ex superioribus . . . . possit] In order to explain esc, most commen-
tators give sunt the meaning of extant. Bonnell, however, prefers to con-
sider it an enallage, by which the ex, which properly belongs to quibus
oerspici possit, is anticipated and connected with superioribus libris.
