1. Tum] See 5, 5.

2. M. Crassus] Pliny (H. N. 33, 10) says of Crassus: In agris suis ses-
tertium M M possedit, = 2oo‚000‚000 sesterces in real estate, = 5o,000,000
denarii. If his income from this was only six per cent„ (which was only
half the usual rate of interest sor money at that period,) it yielded him
3‚000‚000 denarii yearly, equal to about 462,ooo dollars of our money.

If we reckon the pay of a common soldier at ten denarii a mouth, as it
was before Julius Caesar raised it, and the number of soldiers in a legion at
6,000, the cost of maintaining one leg10n a mouth is 60,000 denarii, or an
army of four legions a year, 2,880,000 denarii, equal to 443,000 donare,
which is less than the income estimated above. But the maintenance of
an army occasioned other eipenses besides the pay of the legionary .
soldiers. The equites and the superior and inferior officers must be paid.
The property of Crassus, however, was not limited to the real estate men-
tioned above. Compare the calculations of Zumpt.

5. Imperiorum, honorum] military and civil office-³.

6. Nulla . . . . requi est] This quotation is supposed by some to refer ,ιο
the sons of OEdipus.

7. Declaravit id modo] Julius Caesar was assassinated in the spring of
the year in which Cicero wrote this book.

Propter eum . . . . principatum] According to 4, 6, there is implanted in
man's moral nature an appetitio quoedam principatus. But Caesar had formed
a mistaken idea of this principatus, which led him to the violence alluded to.

9. Perturbatione . . . . animi] passion. See Tusc. Disp. 4, 5. “ Quae Groeci
πάθη vocant, nohis perturbationes appellari magis placet quam morbos.’'

Observe the con-esponding terms in the last sentences of the section:
repentino aliquo motu corresponds to perturbatione aliqua animi ,· meditata

and praeparata, to consulto and cogitata. B. Meditata, see Z. Gr. ἓ 632.
De inferenda injuria] Comp. 2, 4.

Cn. IX. 1—5. See Conspectus.

1. Nolunt, impediuntur] Compare ’7, 1.

2. Videndum est, ne non] Z. Gr. ἓ 534, and ξ 535. Literally: we rriust
look to it, lest that be not enouylz, i. e. unsatisfactory.

In philosophos] ort philosopher-⁸, i. e. concerning them.

Expetant . . , . soleant] Beier, Orelli, and others give the indicative, which
would be explained in Zumpt‘s Gr. ξ 547.

3. Nam alterum . . . . incidunt] The difficulties presented by this pas-
sage as it stands have occasioned the suggestion of various changes in the
text. Heusinger proposes to omit justitioe ,aerius ,· Facciolati to insert ἰπ-
justitiae after incidunt. Zumpt leaves the text unchanged and construes
