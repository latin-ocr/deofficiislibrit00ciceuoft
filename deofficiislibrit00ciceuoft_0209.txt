Δ handsome and convenient edition οἰ this great classic, really adapted to the
wants of schools, 11115 long been needed ; the want is here met by Professor Boise in a
manner that leaves nothing to be desired. Decidedly the best German editions,
whether text or commentary bc considered, have appeared within the last few years3
and 01 these Mr. Boise has made free usc3 while, 111 1110 same time, he has not lost
sight os the fact that the classica] schools of this country are behind those of Ger-
many, and that simplet and more elementary explanations are therefore often neccs-
snry in 11 work prepared sor American schools. Nothing has been put in the notes
{or the sake of 11 111010 display of learning‚-—pedantry is out of place in 11 school-book;
and nothing has been introduced by way of comment except what can be turned to
practical use by the render.

'An historical ln‘troduction⁷ which will enable the pupil to enter on his task intel-
ligently, is prefixed. An abundance of geographical information, embodying the
latest discoveries 01' travellers, is supplied3 and the whole is illustratcd with Kie-
pert's excellent map⁷ showing the entire route of the ten thousand 011 their retreat.

This will be round an exceedingly 115οΥ111 book for College classes. The text ls
large and distinct, the typography accurate, and the notes judicious ond scholarly.
Instead of referring the student 10 a variety or books, few os which 1110 within his
resch, the editor has wisely supplied whatever is necessary. An admirable treatlss
on the Life of Socrates introduces the work, and English and Greek Indexes render
lt easy to refer to the text and notes.

From Pnor. 1111111115011, University of Virqim‘a.

¹⁸ The Notes 0011111111, 111 11111011 detail, the ammatical and other explanations
which it would be convenient for the learner to 111νο placed before him, instead of
ksvlng to rerer to various books. 1 have no doubt that the Notes are very caremuy
prepared, and ln accordance with the best authorities.''
