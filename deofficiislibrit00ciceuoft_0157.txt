Lm. 1. oAP. xw. 145

Cn. XV. 1. Sed cum iis . . . . virtutis] The construction is: in quibus
si sunt simulacra, (ize. Compare similar construction, 13, 9. Modestia,-
temperantia . . . . justitia] Comp. 2, 9.

2. Illae virtutes . . . . attinyere] Comp. 6, l.-—Atque haec in moribus]
scil. consideranda sunt. It is to be observed, that in this chapter and the
beginning of the next, Cicero lays down five rules which should govern us
in the practice of beneficence: first, (ἐξ 1, 2,) that we should have regard
to the character, and in that should prefer the mild to the heroic virtues3
(2) (ξ 3,) that we should have regard to the person’s love toward us; (3)
(ἓὲ 4, 5, 6, ’1, 8, 9,) to his favors to us3 (4) (ἓξ 10, 11,) to his necessities;
(5) (ch. XVI, ξ 1,) that regard must be had to the nearness of our connec-
tion with the person. This last rule he expands by setting forth the degree
of our relatiouship, (1) to mankind in general, in remainder of this chapter3
(2) to our countrymen‚ (ch. XVII, gg 1, 2 3) (3) to our relations, (ξ 3—§ 6 ;)
(4) to om· friends, (ἓ ’7-ἓ 10 ;) (5) to the state, (ἓ 11 to end of chap.) Of
these three chapters, the caption, so to speak, is found in XIV, 10. See
Conspectus and Garve’s Anmerkungen.

3. Diliyamur] Z. Gr. ἓ 555.

5. Utenda] Z. Gr. ἓ 657. Quodsi ea . . . . debemus] The meaning of
this sentence is as follows: If when you have borrowed you ought to return
more than you have received, what should we do when we have received
an unasked favor. An imitari] This is really the second part of a dou-
ble question. Compare the remarks of Zumpt in his Gr. ἓ 353.

9. Multa] is the object offaciunt. Vel morbo in omnes] These words
are wanting in one of the best MSS. Heusinger, Beier, and Orelli read
modo instead of morbo, connecting it with judicio, to which Zumpt ob-
jects on account of the word vel, referring for his reasons to his Gram-
mar,§ 386.

10. Quod contra fit] eontra, contrari-wisc. Beier, however, con-
siders quod the object of contra, a case of anastrophe. See Hand’s

Turs. s, v. 111, 1.

4. Ferarum, in quibus inesse fortitudinem dicimus] Cicero has a higher
regard for the milder virtues. Comp. 15, 2.

5. Aa latissime quidem . . . . societas Ioeaec est] Societas hoec, sc. universi
‚qenai-is humani, as he has called it above, ξ 3. Hominibus and omnibus
are datives of the possessor after est. Ut . . . . teneantur] so that( Ut
ementatum eit] as. Observe the difference between the effect of the sub-
junctive in ut constitutum sit, and of the indicative in ut in proverbio est.
E quibus ipsis] se. leyibus : e=accordin9 to.—Oetera, i. e. all things not
included in the lawe. ‘
