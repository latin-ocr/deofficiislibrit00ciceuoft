PREFAGE

Tin-2 text ot tms edition is that of Zumpt, as it is found iu ιἰίε, sman-
er edition,* varied in a very few instances on the authority oi Beier,
Orelli, and Bonnell, and of Zumpt himself. The deviatione from
Zumpt’s text are generally, if not in every case, accounted for in the
notes. ,

The notes are derived chiefly from the editions of Zumpt and Bon-
nell3† which contain, besides their own, the valuable remarks and expla-
nations of the Heusingers and of Degen. Beier and Gernhard have
also been frequently consulted, and especially the notes and treatises
υἱ Garve, who discusses so thoroughly, and in so lucid a manner, the
ideas contained in this work of Cicero. There is an occasional refer-
ence also to the edition of Stuerenburg, to the German interpretation
and notes of Dr. A. W. Zumpt, and to the review of Bonnell in the
Neue Jahrbucher, numbers 2 and 3, of the 55th volume. The reader
has been referred to Freund’s Latin Lexicon, without any citation os
the information required, because it is understood that an American
edition os that excellent work, prepared under the superintendence of a
mature and reliable scholar, is soon to be presented to the public.

The present edition does not profess to contain all the notes of the
commentatore, named above, who have labored on this work, nor indeed
the great body of them. As a general thing, all biographical and his-
torical notes have been omitted. It was thought that learners in this
country were so well supplied with books of reference, containing at
considerable length the information :ecessary for the elucidation of
the text, that it was better to allow them to consult their manuals
themselves, than to furnish them with explanation-s necessarily more
